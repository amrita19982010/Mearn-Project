        <h3>The Great Wall Of China</h3>
        <p>
            The Great Wall of China is the largest man-made structure in the world stretching over 5,000 miles long. Construction on the wall commenced in the 7th century BC and continued for 2 millennia.

            The Great Wall was first conceived during the reign of the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang Di, although it was actually built in many parts by different emperors. In the Qin Dynasty, the emperor ordered thousands of soldiers to build a wall that would stretch across China. After the fall of the Qin Dynasty, the Northern Wei Dynasty restored and expanded the remaining wall to guard against assaults from other tribes. From there, many kingdoms and dynasties throughout the millennia helped repair and finish this magnificent structure.

        <p>
            The Taj Mahal is one of the most beautiful and well-known buildings in the world. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his late wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died giving birth to the couple’s 14th child. It is said to have taken 20,000 men and 22 years to complete.

        <h3>Colosseum</h3>
        <p>
            The Colosseum in Italy was built in 70 and 80 AD and was the largest amphitheater in the world. This magnificent structure is made of concrete and stone and is considered one of the greatest achievements of Roman architecture.

            Every year, millions of tourists visit the Colosseum to see its grandeur for themselves. It is also estimated that over 50,000 people could be seated in the Colosseum at one time.

            The Colosseum was used for gladiator fights and public spectacles such as mock sea battles, animal hunts, executions, and re-enactments of famous battles and dramas. On average, it is estimated that 550,000 people were killed in the Colosseum, and so many animals died that some species even became extinct.

        <h3>Machu Picchu</h3>
        <p>
            Machu Picchu is an ancient Incan city that is located in present-day Peru. The city was built in the 15th century and is situated on a mountain ridge above the Urubamba River valley. Machu Picchu is one of the most well-known and popular tourist destinations in Peru, as well as being one of the Seven Wonders of the World.

            The city was built around 1450, but it was abandoned just a century later at the time of the Spanish conquest. The Incas never revealed their location to the Spanish conquerors, so Machu Picchu was undiscovered for almost 400 years. When Machu Picchu was rediscovered in 1911, it became one of the most famous archaeological sites in South America.

        <h3>Petra</h3>
        <p>
            As one of the oldest cities in the world, Petra is an archaeological wonder in Jordan. It is believed to have been the site where Moses struck a rock and water flowed forth. Later on, in 300 BC, it was established by the Nabataean Arabs. The buildings in Petra are carved from sandstone, and the city contains many rock-cut temples, tombs, and other structures. The structures are designed to let the light shine into the interiors of the buildings.

            The city eventually fell, however, as trade routes changed and two major earthquakes, (363 and 551, respectively) caused more complexity, Petra was eventually abandoned.

            The city was hidden for centuries by the surrounding cliffs and was only rediscovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt.

        <h3>Chichén Itzá El Castillo</h3>
        <p>
            Chichen Itza is located in Mexico and was built by the Mayan people. The Mayan people were a very advanced civilization, and their architecture is unbelievable. The Chichen Itza temple stands 79 feet above the main plaza and was built in such a way that it aligns with the sun during the spring and autumn equinoxes. During these equinoxes, the sun shines directly on the pyramid and casts a shadow in the shape of a snake. It is truly an amazing sight to see.

            The Mayans were very advanced for their time. They practiced agriculture, astronomy, and mathematics. They also built cities and lived in houses that had running water. The Mayan civilization was very successful until it eventually disappeared from the earth around the 11th century.
